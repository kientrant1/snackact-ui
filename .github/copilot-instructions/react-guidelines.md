# React Guidelines

## Component Design

- **Functional Components & Hooks:** Prefer **functional components with React Hooks**. Avoid class components unless explicitly for error boundaries.
- **Single Responsibility:** Each component should ideally have one primary responsibility. **Components should be kept small and focused.**
- **Component Naming:** Use `PascalCase` for all component names (e.g., `MyButton`, `UserAvatar`).
- **Props:**
  - Use `camelCase` for prop names.
  - Destructure props in the component's function signature.
  - Provide clear `interface` or `type` definitions for props in TypeScript.
- **Immutability:** Never mutate props or state directly. Always create new objects or arrays for updates.
- **Fragments:** Use `<>...</>` or `React.Fragment` to avoid unnecessary DOM wrapper elements.
- **Custom Hooks:** Extract reusable stateful logic into **custom hooks** (e.g., `useDebounce`, `useLocalStorage`).
- **UI Components:** Use [RadixUI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) for building UI components to ensure consistency and accessibility.

## State Management

- **Local State:** Use `useState` for component-level state.
- **Global State:** For global or shared state, prefer **React Context API** or a dedicated state management library (e.g., Zustand, Redux, Jotai). Avoid prop drilling.

## Styling

- **Consistent Approach:** use Tailwind CSS v4 or later.
- **Scoped Styles:** Ensure styles are scoped to avoid global conflicts.

## Performance

- **Keys:** Always provide a unique and stable `key` prop when mapping over lists. Do not use array `index` as a key if the list can change.
- **Lazy Loading:** Suggest `React.lazy` and `Suspense` for code splitting large components or routes.
